# The Semblance Project
~~"the outward appearance or apparent form of something, especially when the reality is different."~~  
**Created Thursday, July 28th, 2021**  
The ability to build a form. To give a component data that dictates the form that is displayed in the template.  

A feature. Could have an interface (for form creation) but it is not required.


```json 
"seblance": Array[] = [{
  "title"
  "subtitle"
}]
```
